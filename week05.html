								<h2>Week 5 – Identity, Privacy, and Sharing</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">

								<p>This week we shift to the theme of identity, privacy and sharing. With the access to research resources at CMU we were able to reach out to researchers and professors from the CMU CyLab (CyLab Security and Privacy Institute). Specifically, we contacted experts in the areas of cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, and usability.</p>

								<b>Three big hypotheses that we are trying to answer are:</b>
								<ul>
								<li>How will the new technologies of blockchain and cryptocurrencies change consumers identities online</li>
								<li>People share Identity in different ways to different people organizations</li>
								<li>Are people numb to identity theft and data breaches?</li>
								</ul>


								<b>Some initial insights from interviews:</b>
								<ul>
								<li>Cryptocurrency is not going to replace consumer payment processing just yet as it’s too slow compared to credit card.</li>
								<li>Blockchain does have some amazing potential and is already being used for asset tracking, smart contracts, and other B2B applications.</li>
								</ul>

								<!-- <insert selfie app prototypes here> -->

								<p>
								Testing prototypes: On the side of prototyping, we continued exploring the selfie authentication by creating paper prototypes and tested it with people on the street. We are hoping to learn the threshold of social acceptance and consumer perceptions towards new biometric technology. We did some quick guerrilla research to type our prototype. The major takeaway is that people don’t trust facial recognition technology but are willing to use it if the social context is appropriate.</p>

								<b>Recruiting and preparing for interview:</b>
								<p>Learning from last week, we decide to plan recruiting early for next two weeks’ topics. People we are interested in recruiting are: small business owners that take Venmo, WeChat Pay, Small online merchants, Consumers that use Apple Pay, Venmo, or pre-order online at Starbucks, employees at Shopify. Each person is assigned to two user groups and will be reaching out to at least 10 people by earlier next week. We created a spreadsheet to keep track of interview schedules.</p>


								<b>Revisiting Plan:</b>
								<p>Another step we took this week is making some changes to how we run the team to improve efficiency:</p>
								<b>Physical Scrum board:</b>
								<p>The web Trello board hasn’t been working very well for our team. Instead, we made a physical Trello board and put it up on the office wall so that we can easily refer to it and update any time during the meetings.</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/w05_scrum_board_02.jpg" alt="Z and A at scrum board" /></span>


								<b>Sub-team meetings:</b>
								<p> It is not always efficient to have everyone present for all the meetings. We went back to the our individual roles and responsibilities formed sub teams for research and project management. The sub-team will make plan and assign tasks for the rest of the team. This structure had been working well for us and allows the meeting times to be spent more efficiently.</p>

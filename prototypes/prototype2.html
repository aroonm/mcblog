							<h1>Avatar Storyboards</h1>


							<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

							<p>With the earlier Avatar prototype, users faced a lot of confusion during user testing since we did not fully explain
								why users were providing data, and what benefits of security and convenience they would get in return. So we focused
								on providing a narrative where the user reading the storyboard can see the value of providing personal data to make
								Continuous Authentication work. </p>

								<hr id="prototypes">
							<h2>Prototypes</h2>
							<div class="example">
								<div>
									<img class="image example-img" style="" src="https://www.hamsterbard.com/images/avatar.png">
								</div>
							</div>
							<!-- <div class="example">

							<hr id="research">
							<h2>Research Questions</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>How can we best demonstrate how Continuous Authentication works and its value?</li>
								<li>How do people respond to being asked to provide their personal data?</li>
								<li>In a physical space, how can this technology be more convenient than Apple Pay, or even just using your card?</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Methodology</h2>
							<h4>Number of User Tests: 9</h4>
							<p>Feedback from 2 other Capstone teams, user tested the prototypes with 9 users.</p>
							<p>Users read through a storyboard aloud that brought the context of use to life. We then had a detailed interview on
								how they felt and their thoughts on the concepts.
							</p>
							<hr id="findings">
							<h2>Findings</h2>
							<p>Users have drastically different opinions on this concept. Some users found the avatars adorable, while others found
								it insecure to share the app with another person. The insecurity comes partly from not understanding what the app
								is doing and how Continuous Authentication works.</p>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">01.</span>The avatar concept was perceived as adorable by the younger generation, while useless for the older generation.
								</h3>
							<blockquote>"This would be really cute, and will make me want to purchase more."</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"Creepy? This would be adorable."</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">02.</span>An ideal convenient checkout experience should require low user attention</h3>
							<blockquote>"Seems like a lot just for a payment app"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"When I think about payments, I don't want to think about payments"</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">03.</span>Skepticism with the hand-off scenario (where the CA system can tell between different people holding the
								same phone)</h3>
							<blockquote>"I don't know how that would work. Would a calibration process take place? How reasonable is that in real world usage?"</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">04.</span>Friction in the payment process may be preferable</h3>
							<blockquote>"I like a little bit of friction, otherwise I might overspend, I don't trust myself"</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">05.</span>There are concerns with data being collected constantly, as well as the types of data</h3>
							<blockquote>What does it mean it mimics her movements (on the avatar mirroring the user's gestures? Like her whole body? That's
								really creepyâ€¦"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I don't want to give up all my information at once. I don't want one app tohave all the access to this information."</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">06.</span>Social factors play a large part in user adoption</h3>
							<blockquote>"I would probably not [use this service] unless it became popular and ubiquitous"</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">07.</span>Mixed reactions to facial data being collected. People weren't as squeamish about sharing their facial
								data as we thought.</h3>
							<blockquote>"I don't want my face videoed all the time. I'm more comfortable with camera usage on my phone than my computer."</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I don't mind, I feel like it's already out there, I don't care."</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I don't want the camera to be on all the time."</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"From a tech perspective it adds a layer of reassurance"</blockquote>

							<h3>
								<span class="h3-num">08.</span>Designing (cute) products which people don't associate with serious things like 'finance' could be problematic.</h3>

							<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

							<p>We had 20 study participants over 4 different tracks. Each one visited a new website daily to use a variety of checkout
								flows. The 8-10 day study wrapped up last week and we had post-interviews over the two weeks. This week we have been
								analyzing the results, from qualitative to quantitative, and distilling the insights that will go into the UX Guidelines
								we plan to deliver to the client.</p>

							<h4>Study Narrative</h4>

							<p>All four tracks (A, B, C and D) experienced the first three days using our website checkouts as the "normal" web checkout
								requiring the customer to enter all their info - name, shipping, billing, and credit card info on a web form, and
								submitting. We alternated the types of websites, and pre-selected generic objects for participants to checkout -
								a pillow, a basket, a mug, sandwiches, a camera.</p>

							<h2>Methodology</h2>

							<h4>

								<br> 20 participants
								<br> 45 min pre-study interview
								<br> 1 hour post-study interview
							</h4>
							<div class="example">

									<sub>A screenshot of the study plan.</sub>
								</div>
							</div>
							<h4>Daily Survey</h4>
							<p>After the participants completed the checkout process, they would fill out a quick survey of their experience:
								<strong>
									<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceBhi4F2dCNGVDoYTFt3ZZkASaG8F3z9CaRXAQPRUxLjq0Tg/viewform">Daily Survey [Google Forms]</a>
								</strong>
							</p>

							<h4>Analysis process</h4>

							<p>With 20 participants, pre and post interviews, as well as the daily survey response feedback, we had tons and tons
								of data to sift through. The post interviews are where most of the meat came from, and we embarked on another large
								affinity diagram process, across tracks and days.</p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<p>We also have aggregated graphs of each track and their comfort levels per day. There are definitely some interesting
								insights here that we're still analyzing.</p>

							<p>Overall, this was a great last sprint to end on and an educational experience from a research side. We learned tons
								about asking the right questions at the right time, setting up the right number</p>

							<h2>Prototypes</h2>

							<p>The first three days were simplified checkouts where the user was expected to type in their provided credit card details
								by hand. This was designed to get users into the vein of the test without trying to test variables right away.</p>

							<h4>Day 1, Bed Bath & Beyond:</h4>
							<p>Simple checkout on Bed Bath & Beyond
								<strong>
									<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/BBB.php?uid=01"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
								</strong>
							</p>


							<h4>Day 2, Whole Foods:</h4>
							<p>Simple checkout on Whole Foods
								<strong>
									<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wf.php?uid=01"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
								</strong>
							</p>


							<h4>Day 3, Walmart:</h4>
							<p>Simple checkout on Walmart
								<strong>
									<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wm1.php?uid=01"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
								</strong>
							</p>

							<!-- <hr id="day4"> -->

							<h4>Day 4, H&M:</h4>

							<p>On the fourth day, every track experiences the first "autofill" day (simulating using Continuous Authentication for
								the first time). This is where it starts to differentiate between tracks.</p>

							<strong>Day 4 - Track A - Autofilled, no explanation:
								<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/hm.php?uid=07">
								&#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
							</strong>
							<p>These users are never told what is going on. No mention of any change to their authentication flow, them being enrolled
								in any new program, or changes to the payment process whatsoever.</p>
							<p>Our hypothesis with them is that, potentially in non-EU markets, this data collection could be feasible, but customers
								may be sketched out when it autofills without explanation. This rang true and people were weirded out by it autofilling
								on day 4.</p>


							<strong>Day 4 - Track B - NOT Autofilled, Opt-in:
								<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/hm.php?uid=08"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
							</strong>
							<p>These users are politely asked if they would like to opt in to a service, Mastercard Instant Checkout, that pre fills
								in their data. Their data on Day 4 is NOT prefilled (the only track it's not) and they must opt-in via a pop-up bubble.
								It is more convenient and secure. In the post interview no one could remember if they opted in or not, and regardless,
								we autofilled their data anyway. These users did mention the Mastercard branding and checkmarks we added, and "encrypted"
								text as reassuring.
								<p>


									<strong>Day 4 - Track C - Autofilled, opt-out:
										<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/hm.php?uid=01"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
									</strong>
									<p>Track C users were very much like track B expect we assume they want it and opt them in from the start on day 4.
										Their info is prefilled and they can opt-out if they like. No one chose to opt-out, and this had the highest aggregate
										comfort score across the entire study.</p>


									<strong>Day 4 - Track D - Autofilled, with progress bar=100%:
										<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/hm.php?uid=18">
										&#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
									</strong>
									<p>Unlike the previous three tracks, track D is fully aware of what Continuous Authentication is, and have been fully
										educated. For the first few days, their authentication profile was "learning" and there was a green progress bar
										that showed how complete it was. It became complete on day 3 and the use the autofill feature on day 4. However,
										we cannot say overall their comprehension of the system was any better than the other tracks, and in some cases
										worse. They had the most varied comfort, surprisingly, and had some notable misunderstandings of the progress bar.</p>

									<h4>Day 5, Bed, Bath, and Beyond:</h4>

									<strong>Plain Autofilled:
										<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/BBB.php?uid=15"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
									</strong>
									<p>For day 5, everyone gets the same checkout with the information autofilled.

							<h3><span class="h3-num">5b.</span>Education before use doesn't necessarily increase comprehension during use.</h3>
							<h3><span class="h3-num">5c.</span>Tracking "browsing behavior" makes users feel uncomfortable.</h3> -->

										<!-- <hr id="day6"> -->

										<h4>Day 6, Whole Foods:</h4>

										<strong>First Step Up:
											<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wm.php?uid=15"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
										</strong>
										<p>This day they are buying an expensive camera on Walmart.com. Everyone gets some type of step-up, a prompt for further
											authentication. We tested various types of step ups from a standard email sent code, to more out-there experiments.
											Most people verbally said these made them feel more secure, like Mastercard was watching out for them, while paradoxically
											selecting lower numbers on the comfort scale. We think this is because some of the experimental step ups were
											not very robust on different devices and hard to use.</p>

										<!-- ====================== -->
										<!-- <h3><span class="h3-num">6a.</span>Falling back to an existing authentication method is comforting to users, and enhances the experience as it reinforces their current mental model</h3>

										<h4>Day 8, H&M:</h4>

										<strong>Second Step Up:
											<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/hm2.php?uid=06"> &#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>

										<strong>Email Pincode
											<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wm.php?uid=12">&#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
										</strong>
										<p>This is the most typical step up of the bunch and currently used today, where a pincode or link is sent to the
											user via text or email.</p>

										<strong>Circle the Donut
											<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wm.php?uid=05">&#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
										</strong>
										<p>Users with this step up identified "their" donut out of an array of 6 donuts. When prompted with the array, they
											had to select their predetermined donut. This is playing off a Microsoft interaction called Picture Password.</p>

										<strong>Draw a Star
											<a href="https://mysterious-wave-18544.herokuapp.com/wm.php?uid=08">&#8594 Live Prototype Here</a>
										</strong>
										<p>Using mouse or touchscreen input as a unique factor, users are prompted to draw a star in a canvas box. Some academic
											research shows drawing like this could be used as a unique identifying factor.</p>

										<strong>Swipe through Gallery

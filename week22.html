<header><h4><b>We went to NYC!</b></h4></header>

<p>We had the great fortune to take the whole team to Mastercard’s Digital Payments and Labs office in the Flatiron neighborhood of New York City! This was a terrific chance for us to get expert feedback and interviews with internal people at Mastercard, get specific feedback on prototypes, and discuss the most valuable problems to work on for the last 6 weeks of the project.<p>

<p>Moreover, we would get a chance to see exactly how the user experience team operates, and what their core values are, allowing us to develop a product, or products, that Mastercard will find real value in. This visit to NYC also allowed us to better formalize a go-to-market strategy, which our clients have explicitly asked from us.</p>

<header><h4><b>What we presented in NYC</b></h4></header>

<p>Prep and visit Mastercard Digital Payments and Labs NYC</p>

<p>We prepped for our trip to Mastercard the first part of the week and left Wednesday to be in-office for Thursday and Friday. The goal of the trip was to get client feedback and critique, as well as expert insights for product positioning, design for trust, and technology implementation issues. We prepared a slew of prototypes and made 5 posters bucketing our research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Onboarding Experience</li>
	<li>Digital Checkout</li>
	<li>Consumer Adoption</li>
	<li>Privacy and Creepiness</li>
	<li>Physical Checkout</li>
</ul>

<header><h4><b>NYC Feedback and Crit</b></h4></header>

<p>The NYC trip was a terrific source of information and we’ve locked in the focus for the rest of the summer. Amin found specific people with terrific insight in designing similar systems. We talked with PMs that shipped tokenization technology and 3D Secure, another multiple factor security platform that had terrific insight on our issues. It was very reassuring to hear from Karen Pascoe, the SVP of Design, that this is a very timely topic for MC and our findings are of value to actual products. Our lunch crit with a dozen designers was a great roundtable discussion - they were very sharp and got immediately to the bone of the issue, asking interesting questions and prodding us in areas we haven’t discussed.</p>

<span class="image fit" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><img src="images/w22_nyc_posterpres.jpg" alt="" /></span>


<header><h4><b>Direction and Deliverables for 6 weeks</b></h4></header>

<p>We proposed in NYC a set of three deliverables:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(1) an onboarding experience via a bank app</li>
	<li>(2) merchant examples of flows for digital omni-channel checkouts, and</li>
	<li>(3) a short set of UX guidelines based on our research and findings of consumer perceptions and issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback from experts here prompted us to consider some new facets that could be valuable for Mastercard. The different markets will require quite different approaches. The EU could be the most fastidious and conservative consent requirement, while China and possibly the US could be entirely unregulated. We learned about a bunch of specific technologies and governing standards to look at - EMV 2.0 and 3DSecure both seem to have prior art we can leverage in messaging and design. And design - both a UX researcher and content strategist joined the session and had great ideas and suggested we try a diary study as well as a journey map for various levels of authentication.</p>

<p>All in all the trip to NYC was well worth the effort. While we are still consolidating feedback, we received critical input from the client and are looking forward to finishing off the summer strong with a solid set of agreed upon deliverables that will be of immediate use to Mastercard’s design team.</p>

<p>It was a really fruitful trip for us. Sharing our ideas with people from different teams, we were exposed to a number of real-world challenges our prototypes might face. GDPR and data privacy, cross environment feasibility, and many other challenges toward implementing continuous authentication were thought-provoking for us. It was also motivating to learn that our clients found our chosen topic highly relevant to what they do, and even one step further into the future. Besides work, we had a lot of fun in Koreatown!</p>

<p>New York, New York. The day and a half at the Mastercard offices went by much too fast.
Every meeting had its own flavor. For example, I learned a lot of colorful language from the SVP of User Experience at Mastercard, Karen Pascoe. Language like ‘up-level’, as in communicating something at a higher level, and ‘sausage-making’, referring to how something works. The meeting with Kosta, Chris and Derek, all tech people, felt like the three of them were just ‘talking shop’ amongst each other, and trying to solve sticky challenges related to Continuous Authentication. We just eagerly observed and took notes. The design team lunch feedback session was by far the most chaotic, with the room full of designers, but perhaps the most valuable.</p>

<p>This trip was hugely beneficial for our project and I’m looking forward to the next few weeks when all the stuff we’ve learned will be put to the (user) test.</p>

<strong>Scott Leinweber</strong>

<p>I was very impressed with the level of feedback we got around questions that had been tickling us for a while. Most of our interviews lasted only 45 mins, but everyone interviewed got right to the hard issues of our problem space, balancing privacy and trust, brand image and tracking, and tech and business/product implementations. Outside of the office, we caught up with the Bloomberg Capstone team over Korean BBQ, drank our share of boba tea, and enjoyed the summer nights around Manhattan.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to see what we are working on aligns with Mastercard’s core value. Everyone we talked to - designers, product managers or engineers were all interested in the topic and brought their unique perspective to the table. It really helped to confirm some of our early assumptions and informed us about constraints. And though it was such a short time, I really enjoyed being in New York. It is a city with a diverse and inspiring culture. And of course, a lot of good food!</p>

<header><h4><b>Spinning our wheels</b></h4></header>


<p>The past two weeks we focused on the toughest and most constrained design space we've had yet. Last week we dialed into merchants and what they need. Explored various types of merchants we saw just how wide of an array a Point of Sale provider has to accommodate, and how varied small businesses are.</p>

<p>We did discuss a lot about what business value Mastercard can bring to merchants, how POS systems fit into the equation, the crushing realities of the physical space, and revisiting and reframing what our scope actually is. Eventually we realized we can't satisfy it all, and we just had to start making things. Do one small thing, do it well.
</p>

<header><h4><b>Narrow, narrow, narrow</b></h4></header>


<p>We started out with grocery stores and fast food / coffee shops. We decided to focus down to just coffee shops for the prototype, since Starbucks has been a major observation site and testing ground for us.</p>

<p>Our chief constraint was that we don't want businesses to have to buy new hardware. It's easy to design a technology solution that tracks people and what they're buying - if you just add loads of cameras and sensors to the place. However, we identified this is the main reason Google Hands Free and Paypal have failed in the physical store: The capital costs of buying sensing gear for a POS system is too steep. Merchants just want something that works and is cheap.
So this pushed us to have all the computing on the customers device.</p>

<header><h4><b>5 Prototypes</b></h4></header>

<p>We know the onboarding experience will be critical no matter what, and since we were trying to offload the computation to the customers device, we prototyped the onboarding experience (on a customers phone) and the ideal purchase flow (at the merchant's counter/POS) for five different authentication.</p>


<ol>
	<li>Verbal - customer adds a customer name and orders using this name, "Hi, I'm Dan Smith."</li>
	<li>Video Raw - Much like the lemonade stand prototype, there's a raw video capture using facial recognition.</li>
	<li>Video Animoji - Facial recognition here as well but the customer doesn't see raw video and instead sees a live animoji of themselves</li>
	<li>Pincode - A basic 4-6 digit pin code the customer determines beforehand</li>
	<li>Phone touch - An NFC reader much like Apple Pay currently</li>
</ol>

<header><h4><b>Contextual Inquiry Research</b></h4></header>

<p>While simultaneously developing the prototypes for each of these methods, two of us also went out on the town to 15 various coffee shops, from corporate chains to local indie shops, to observe and map the sequence of events, chart number of card transactions vs. cash, see app usage, and interview some folks. This ended up being a very productive morning of a quick contextual inquiry. </p>

<p><b>Some interesting takeaways:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The sequence after ordering of pay and receive is highly variable based on if the order is simple enough. Drip coffee - they serve it to you and then ask you to pay. Double shot Latte - they'll take your money, and then you wait for them to make it. </li>
<li>Cash vs. Card - Shadyside had much more cash usage, while Pitt and CMU had much more card.</li>
<li>Starbucks app usage for rewards points is 49%, which seems extreme.</li>
<li>Every barista we talked with said they recognized regulars, and had their orders memorized. Some will even start making the drink while seeing the customer walk across the street.</li>
</ul>

<header><h4><b>Testing</b></h4></header>

<p>We tested with 5 participants from college to middle age. Here are the results of some basic questions we surveyed afterwards.</p>

<span class="image fit" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><img src="images/w20_dataviz.png" alt="" /></span>
<br><br>

<header><h4><b>Conclusions</b></h4></header>

<p>Some initial conclusions from this sprint and prototype testing:</p>

<p><b>Customization</b> - Even among our small sample, all 5 prototypes were selected a preferred by different participants. This reinforces earlier ideas that no one method is ideal, and a variety of methods should be available to the user to select.</p>


<p><b>Multiple users per card, Multiple cards per user</b> - A participant this round surfaced an issue we discussed in the spring of how does CA work for multiple users on the same card? Since it is very biometrically tied to an individual, would it be possible for a couple to share a card? Could it work on a corporate card with multiple users?</p>

<p><b>Physical Cards work very well</b> - In the end, we've reified how convenient and solid physical cards are in a physical store. They actually work great. We've been using them for 70 years. Everyone knows how they work. They don't have to be charged. In short, they're great. If we think phone payments are a nice new step, it will be for some value add beyond convenience.</p>

<p><b>Back to Customer Side</b> - While we imagined doing more for merchants this summer, we decided that POS systems are out of our scope, and physical brick-and-mortar stores are less important for us. We will tack back to customer experience, and likely develop the digital space more. In the end, we decided the merchant focus should only be one sprint.</p>

<p><b>Communicating CA</b> - The key takeaway from this week is the realization that it is very difficult to communicate what CA is and how it works. Most participants still didn't understand that the system must continuously track you, and it's through this that the authentication works. This will kick off out next sprint - How can we communicate CA most effectively?</p>

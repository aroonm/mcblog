								<h2>Week 24 - Diary Study Rollout</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">



		<p>We realized that we couldn’t get the data we needed with just 60-90 minute user interviews, it doesn’t give us insight on how people actually feel when shopping day to day. In a constrained interview setting, we won’t be able to give people a sense of what ‘continuous’ (in Continuous Authentication) really means and how it can help streamline the digital payment experience compared to what it's like today.</p>

		<p>This sprint (which is two weeks long, due to the holiday this week) we decided to launch a 10 day ‘pager study’, where we take users through a 10 day payment journey they’ve never seen before.</p>

		<p>We’ve split up prototypes into 4 streams: A2, B1, B2 and C1. At first we had six different streams, but after a few tests from other capstone teams, we were able to combine some scenarios to reduce complexity.</p>



		<p>The first three days, including the day they come in for an introductory meeting, they shop on three different websites (Bed Bath & Beyond, H&M, and Walmart). It’s a completely traditional experience that reflects how people shop online currently. This is analogous to a user’s profile being created over time as they shop within a Continuous Authentication system.</p>

		<p>The 4th day, this hypothetical profile is completed and Mastercard Instant Checkout begins autofilling their data since they have authenticated the person shopping on the device.</p>

		<p>At this point, we’re testing four different kinds of auto-fill experiences. People in the A2 stream experiences no explanation whatsoever for the auto-fill. MC Instant Checkout happens invisibly and for the benefit of the consumer, but its rolled out to all MC customers silently.</p>

		<p>In the B1 stream, data is NOT autofilled and the user is prompted to opt into the service.</p>

		<p>For B2 people, data IS autofilled and the user gets a prompt explaining the service while providing an option to opt out.</p>

		<p>For C1 people, we will onboard them during the introductory interview phase with the onboarding prototype we created the last Sprint. They know what is going on from the start of the study. They also see a progress bar during the first 3 days of ‘normal’ checkout. On day 4, that progress bar fills up to 100%, indicating the profile has been fully created and their data will be auto-filled.</p>

		<p>We’ve recruited 20 participants for this 10 day study, with diverse demographics and occupations. It’s definitely our most robust research effort to date.</p>

		<p>For kicking off the first few users, this was the first time that the team was split up and people were checking in remotely since both Scott and Zohaib were out of town. Since we’re not used to that, our team communication was tested. Slack works well enough, but we did have to trust each other that everything was going to be prepared to roll out the first diary study users on this last Monday.</p>

		<p>In the future, being more upfront about what level of communication is expected will help all of us know exactly what’s going on and enable greater transparency. We can improve documentation to help this as well. This is a larger study, with ~20 participants, each requiring a quasi-unique email daily.</p>

		<p>The results of the diary study will start to take shape next week, and we will be shaping our last sprint on its results.</p>

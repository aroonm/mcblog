						<b>Tackling design challenges</b>
					</h2>
				</header>

				<br>

				<p id="introduction">Our early design prototypes quickly pointed to three critical states we need to design for.</p>

				<p>Onboarding - Merely explaining what Continuous Authentication is a steep task. We need to allow time for users to develop
					a new mental model that transitions from the traditional binary authentication to a more gradient like paradigm.</p>

				<p>Ideal State - Naturally we are designing for an ideal state, that is quicker than today’s authentication methods, and
					more secure. Many questions around this phase rely on users relationship to their personal data and how they will opt-in
					to this service.</p>

				<p>Failed State - The last state we need to prototype and solve for is what happens when someone’s authentication is uncertain
					and the system needs a “step-up” - another factor is asked of the user to authenticate.</p>

					<blockquote>I'd
						<b>like it to show me</b> what Continuous Authentication is while I'm doing it.</blockquote>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
						<b>Check boxes help me know</b> that I have to acknowledge and accept what I'm agreeing to.</blockquote>

					<p>
						<br>We wanted to demonstrate how continuous authentication works in the context of online shopping by providing a realistic
						on-boarding experience. We created 2 versions of the customer sign-up web flow in high fidelity. One provides a step-by-step
						explanation of the kind of data being collected, the other gives little explanation and runs in the background.</p>

					<p>We found that users often skip the verbal description of the definition, but with the step-by-step process, users can
						better articulate the definition of continuous authentication. </p>

					<blockquote>I feel fine, companies are doing all this stuff (collecting location, device, etc. data) for marketing. It's common.</blockquote>
					<br>

					<blockquote>I don't want my face videoed all the time. I'm more comfortable with camera usage on my phone than my computer.</blockquote>
					<br>

					<br>

					<p>
						<br>We listed all possible types of data that continuous authentication might collect and see how users react to each type
						of data. We also explored three different ways of prompting users to provide data. First is the online on-boarding
						web flow. Second is an app-based interface that has an Accuracy scale that changes as users provide more data. Third
						is an avatar game app where an avatar of the user prompts users for sharing data.</p>

					<p>We found that people are generally comfortable providing data that are already being tracked constantly such as location,
						device and wifi-footprint. However, a large percentage of people are reluctant about providing facial data mostly due
						to the fear of being tracked without consent. There is more negative reaction towards the use on camera on the laptop
						than on the phone because the phone isn’t pointing directly to the face in a lot of the times. While providing data,
						users also felt more comfortable sharing when they understand how those data would help them get authenticated.

					<p>We tested two prototypes: one is the avatar game, where data is collected in the background while people interact with
						a fun little avatar of themselves. The other is a checkout authentication pop-up that shows the type of data being
						collected and verified at the moment.</p>
					<p>We found that while people want to know exactly what data they are giving up during on-boarding. They don’t want to
						think about payment or authentication while they pay. Showing data being collected every time only reminds them how
						potential invasive the technology could be and costs trust in the technology.</p>

				<p>We wanted to test ways to recover when continuous authentication fails. Our prototype used the existing method –– 2-factor-authentication
					with SMS.</p>
				<p>Most all of the users felt comfortable with using 2FA SMS. This confirmed some assumptions we had around 2FA becoming
					more and more commonplace and a known mental model for people.</p>

				<br>
				<br>

				<p>Up to this presentation of findings at the end of spring semester, we have focused on the consumer first, honing in on
					these first design sprints on
					<b>customer perceptions around creepiness</b> as well as the hard part of onboarding this new technology.</p>

				<p>As we push into the summer we will continue to answer some of the questions we have on the Consumer Experience while
					shifting towards
					<b>Merchant Adoption and how it works inside stores</b>. This will include
					<b>Technology challenges</b> and
					<b>Business Strategy concerns</b>.</p>
